Milestone 2:
Just to refresh everyoneâ€™s memory of what our project is intended to do: it will be a GUI based program that procedurally generates images from text and vice versa that will be obtained from user input. Essentially, every string of text would generate a unique picture and the same in reverse. 
To get these images to map to text, we will be creating what is most similar to a hashtable in Python. Betty will be doing so and attempting to build/imitate a database that will hold these mapped texts and images. 
J is responsible for the algorithms associated with the user input, as well as the overall functionality of what exactly is supposed to appear when a word(s) or image(s) is searched. 
Rainie is in charge of the overall design and look of our GUI. Basically, she will create the layout and blueprint of the GUI, making it aesthetically pleasing for our users. 
We have been brainstorming and working on paper and white board, trying to visualize what exactly we want this to look like, rather than writing actual code for it yet. But it is soon to come!
